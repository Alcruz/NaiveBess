Data Camp Project: NA√èVE BEES: IMAGE LOADING AND PROCESSING

The question at hand is: can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? These bees have different behaviors and appearances, but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart.

Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like colony collapse disorder threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.

This notebook walks through loading and processing images. After loading and processing these images, they will be ready for building models that can automatically detect honeybees and bumblebees.
